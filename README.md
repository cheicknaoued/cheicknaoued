Hi there! Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Data Science at Bellevue University (graduating in March 2025). I bring a unique blend of technical skills and hands-on experience in GIS mapping, data visualization, Python programming, and CAD drafting to build meaningful projects that solve real-world problems.

ðŸ”¹ Passionate about data-driven decision-making, GIS mapping, and predictive analytics
ðŸ”¹ Proficient in Python, SQL, R, and software like ArcGIS Pro, Revit, and AutoCAD
ðŸ”¹ Always curious and ready to learn new tools and technologies
